# Course description
<a name="description"/>

This course will consider some large questions surrounding ethics in artificial intelligence systems. These questions include:

- Do computers make decisions in a way that is more fair and less biased than people?

- What are the political, legal, social, economic and technological forces that govern the digital world? Which forces are in opposition? Which forces are aligned?
